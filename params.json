{"name":"Network Probe","tagline":"network testing","body":"### About Network-Probe.\r\nThis is an open source project for testing the network connection between any two computers, based on `Winsock2, Socket Library`.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nThe project contains three different versions:\r\n\r\n1. Basic Prototype for network speed probe. \r\n* The basic prototype can only run on Windows OS, and it can connect to any host. But the UDP error checking mechanism has some bugs which results in extremely high error rate.\r\n* It also contains a hostname resolution function. You can check every website or host's ip address and related information.\r\n\r\n2. Network Probe for multiuser. \r\n* You can run only server at a public computer and test the network speed from any of your client computer to the server. No limitation for the client number.\r\n* Robustness has been considered and the server runs in multithreading mode. Once a thread died or unexpectedly crash, the other thread will not be affected.\r\n* Available for `Windows`, `Ubuntu`, and `CentOS`.\r\n\r\n3. Simple Webserver Probe.\r\n* Put all the files that you want to let user access in the same directory. It can handle basic browser HTTP REQUEST, and return the information it want.\r\n* Tested with httperf so the robustness can be guaranteed.\r\n* Two modes supported: On-Demand Mode and Thread Pool Mode.\r\n* Available for `Windows`, `Ubuntu`, and `CentOS`. \r\n\r\n### How to install?\r\n\r\n* **In Linux**\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./NetProbe    #will show you the usage \r\n$ ./NetProbe (arguments according to the usage)\r\n```\r\n* **In Windows**\r\nNetProbe.exe to be released. You can compile by yourself. Please select `Win32 Console` and add `EZ_TIMER.H` to the header files.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCopyright by @ljxangus Jonathan.

This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with\r\n    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. \".cpp\" files are associated with the\r\n    \"Source Files\" filter).\r\n\r\n* NetProbe.cpp\r\n    \r\n    This is the main application source file.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther standard files:\r\n\r\n* StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp\r\n    \r\n    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file\r\n    named NetProbe.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\nAppWizard uses \"TODO:\" comments to indicate parts of the source code you\r\nshould add to or customize.\r\n\r\n---\r\n","google":"UA-61375268-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
